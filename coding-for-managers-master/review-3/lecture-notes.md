Today we will review what we've learnt in Ruby. You will be able to ask questions and clarify some specific points you want to clarify.

## <a href="https://github.com/product-school/bootstrap-lesson">Bootstrap/Responsive Design</a>

Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only. -Wikipedia

## <a href="https://github.com/product-school/javascript-lesson">Javascript</a>

Like Java, Python, and Ruby, JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to build systems that do cool things. One of the benefits of JavaScript is that it can run in your browser, serving as a ‘client-side’ scripting language. Any cool effects that you see on a webpage are likely enabled by JavaScript.

## <a href="https://github.com/product-school/bootstrap-rails">Bootstrap Integration</a>

Earlier in the curriculum we learned about the different ways one could use Bootstrap to help ease styling.  In this lesson we take a closer look at how to integrate different templates into the Rails platform and how to use these templates to help make your style look more professional.

## <a href="https://github.com/product-school/jquery-lesson">JQuery</a>

DOM stands for **Document Object Model**. It's a fancy way of describing what's going on in your browser when you visit a website. You may think a webpage is just a chunk of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. But, there's an important step between a webpage being pure data (text) and being a rendered page users can explore. Everything you interact with in the browser can be represented as a JavaScript object. For example, this paragraph is an object, and it's full of information about being an HTML `<p>` tag.

## <a href="https://github.com/product-school/unit-testing">RSPec Testing</a>

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. -Wikipedia
