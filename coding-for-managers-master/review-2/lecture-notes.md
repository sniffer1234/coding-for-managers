Ruby is a backend scripting language. Many of the JavaScript constructs that you learned, such as functions, variables, objects, iterators, and conditionals, are very similar to those used in Ruby. The main difference between Ruby and JavaScript is that JavaScript is asynchronous (multiple tasks can be running at one time), while Ruby is synchronous (tasks must be run sequentially). One of the benefits of Ruby is that it includes a huge library of methods and built in functionality, which makes your life a lot easier. Another benefit of Ruby, is that Rails, a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework with an abundance of open-source functionality plug-ins that you can integrate into your app, is built on top of it enabling you to combine the two to quickly build awesome websites.

Rails is an open-source Model View Controller (MVC) framework that is built in Ruby. It does the hard work of designing the configurations and file structure you need to build your app. Rails includes a vast source of helper methods and functionally that speed up your web development process. On top of that, Rails integrates with ‘gems’ (similar to JavaScript libraries), which allow you to integrate additional functionality into your app, without building it yourself. Given the size of the Rails community, there is a high-quality, well-maintained gem for almost any functionality you’d like to build.

Adding authentication and authorization is extremely vital to any modern web application. The need for basic security and authenticaiton is essential for good data and customer experience. We will spend today adding the 'Devise' gem to our blog appliction. This is a program that will help us integrate the tools needed to authenticate and authorize users. With this gem we will not need to write the complicated code needed to add security to our pages.

Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only. -Wikipedia
