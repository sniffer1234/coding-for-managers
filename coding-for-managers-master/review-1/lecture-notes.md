# Course Review : Front-End Development

During this class, we will review together key concepts we learn about the HTML, CSS and Git/Github. You will be able to ask questions and clarify some specific points you want to clarify.

## What you will learn in this course
* Review HTML and how to use tags
* Review CSS, selectors, classes, ids
* Review Git and Github
* Go further and learn about Sass

HTML (Hyper-text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) represent the skeleton and outer-facade of any page that you see on the Internet. Any front-end or full-stack developer will be working with these daily. The basic concepts within HTML and CSS can be learned quickly and you’ll have time to deepen your knowledge of specific attributes, tricks, and resources over time.

HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process. To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page! -W3Schools


## <a href="https://github.com/product-school/git-and-github">Git/Github</a>
The combination of Git (on your local computer) and Github (online) is a powerful toolset that enables developers to have a record and access to any versions of the code they create. Github allows developers to have a single repository online where they can share code and review new code before it is merged into their production code base. We’ll cover the basics of Git, Github, and how teams of developers use these tools to collaborate on their projects.

The basic functionality of git allows developers to track specific versions of their code-base, and revert to a previous version at any time (say, their most recent changes broke their system and they wanted to return to the previous version of their code). Git also enables developers to interact with online platforms like Github and Heroku where they can share and host their codebase.
