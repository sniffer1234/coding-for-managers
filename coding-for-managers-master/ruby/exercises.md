# Exercise

## name_length

*Write a function `name_length` that takes an array of strings as an argument, and return how many of the names are longer than 4 characters. Hint: use a variable for counting, the `.each` method and an `if` conditional*

## RobotFriend
*Our robot friend is a little slow. Upgrade it to be faster and try invoking/calling/executing the `make_introduction` method. Maybe upgrade it again and call the `invite_companion_to_dinner`.*

*Add another method to our RobotFriend class called `change_companion` that takes one argument: a name. The method must first print a line saying goodbye to the old companion, then it must change the instance variable, then it must print a line introducing itself to the new companion.*
