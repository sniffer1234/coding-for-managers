## Adding a feature to your blog.

We're going to add some real functionality to the favoriting system

What is the broad overview of what we want to achieve with our persistent favorites?

* current user sees an empty star icon (if the current user hasn't favorited it yet) next to each post and a cumulative favorited count from all users

* see a full star icon if the current user has favorited it

What is the broad overview of how we might achieve this?

* when the user clicks on a star, an ajax request is made to the server

* the server receives the ajax request, creates a record of the favorite, noting both the primary key (id) of both the user and the post so that they can be linked together.

* a response is sent back to the client with data indicating the new favorite count for the post

* in the success handler for the AJAX call we update the UI with the favorite count and a new full star icon

So what do we need?

1. A [join table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_entity) and model for favorites

You should be presented with a migration file like so:
```rb
class CreateFavorites < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :favorites do |t|
      t.integer :user_id
      t.integer :post_id

      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
```

2. Some model logic to record / count favorites

Inside of your `favorite.rb`, create a class-level (`def self.method_name`) method named `mark_favorite` that takes two arguments: `post_id` and `user_id`. The first order of business is to create a database record with those two pieces of information. We can do that with `Favorite.create(user_id: user_id, post_id: post_id)`. *This will ensure that each favorite record will have a `post_id` and a `user_id`, linking the primary id's together*. Next, we want to count all the favorites for the relevant post. We can do that by querying all the favorite entries using the `where` method with the post's id and asking for the count. That should be one line and should be the last line in the method - therefore it will also be the return value, handing off the cumulative favorite count to the controller.


3. An API controller

Create a new controller called `favorites_controller.rb` in your `api/v1` directory.
The controller should call the `mark_favorite` method on the `Favorite` class, pass in the `current_user`'s id and the id of the post from the `params` hash and render a JSON count of total favorites for the post back to the client.

4. A route

In your `routes.rb` file, create a new custom route for the favorite API. It should follow the same form as the weather route, however this will be a `post` request instead of a `get` request.


5. Migrate and add Rails model associations

*With these associations, you will now have access to a method called `favorites` on users and posts. With this, you could create a favorites section for each of your users to record / show their favorite items. You could also potentially display a list of users who have favorited a speicific post.*

6. A data property on each post in our HTML to help us know each post's id

HTML5 brought along with it an amazing feature - data properties on HTML elements. That means we can attach data onto any elements by specifying an HTML element property like so with a key - value pair: `data-<keyname>="<value>"`. In our case, we want to add a new `id` data property named `data-id` (`id` is the keyname) onto each favorite icon div that the user will be clicking on. The value will be each post's `id`, which we can get by accessing the post's `id` property like so: `post.id`. This will let our click handler identify which post our user has clicked as a favorite. Add this new HTML element property onto the element in `index.html.erb` that has the `glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty favorite` class.


7. A counter element in our HTML

In the same `<td>` as our star icon and just below it. We can use the `favorites` convenience method on our `post` object because we told Rails about the association between posts and favorites when we said `has_many :favorites` in our Post model. Then we just need to count the favorites.

8. An AJAX call inside of our click listener
Now that we have a data property that lets us know the id of each post, we can grab that off of the click target (`this`) by accessing the dataset property and then asking for the `id` key. Inside of your `$(".favorite").click` handler, `console.log` the data property of `this` to make sure you have the correct id of each post.


Next, intead of console.logging, we want to pass that piece of information to our server using an AJAX call. Create a new function called `markFavorite` that takes one argument: `postID`. Inside of the function, you should send a `"POST"` request to `/api/v1/mark_favorite`.  You can follow the same AJAX request format found in your `home` view's `index.html.erb` for the weather request, but add in two new properties and values: `method: "POST",` and a data object that has one key and one value: `data: { post_id: postID },`. Make sure you DO NOT have the property `contentType: 'json'`. In the AJAX `success` method, which will take one argument, `response`, you should first put a `console.log(response)` to make sure everthing is working properly.

9. At this point you should have a working solution. The only thing left to do is make the star stay filled in if a user has already liked it. You'll notice that if you navigate away and back tot he index page the stars don't persist. How can we fix this? By using the `favorites` method on the user and seeing if one of their favorites matches the id of the post. We'll need to add some conditional logic into the `index.html.erb`. If `post.favorites.find_by(user_id: current_user.id)` is true, we should show the `glyphicon-star`, otherwise we should show the `glyphicon-star-empty`.
